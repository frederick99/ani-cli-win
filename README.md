# Ani Cli in PowerShell

> Bare minimum is implemented for me to play episodes using VLC.
Might have bugs (don't worry it wont crash your pc.)

See the original project at https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli

Usage:
```sh
./ani-cli haikyuu
```

Important:
- Basic functionality may not work.
- Plays using VLC only.
